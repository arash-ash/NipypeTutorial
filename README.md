# Dataset
The fMRI data is collected using a 3 Tesla MRI in Sabuncu Brain Research Center.
## Experiment 1
In the first block-designed experiment, two flickering left and right wedges were presented with a fixation task.
In one block, the left wedge flickers for 12 seconds, the right wedge flickers for 12 seconds, both flicker for 12 seconds and then both stop flickering for 12 seconds.
First two runs are obtained with this experiment. 

## Experiment 2
In the second similar block-desinged experiment, following indicators are presented and the particiant squeezed his hand in the direction of the arrows for 12 seconds.
Last two runs are obtained with this experiment.

# Nipype Notebook
The Notebook for the preprocessing and GLM analyis of these block design experiments are included.

# Cloud Computing
You can run the notebook on the "cloud" by clicking on Binder icon. Note that you need at least 4GB of ram to run the notebook locally. But binder handles it since it has cluster computing platform.
